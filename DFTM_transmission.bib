abstract = {Intra- and inter-specific effects of cotton, soybean, and clover on the time until death of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Heliothis virescens (F.) larvae lethally infected with H. zea nucleopolyhedrovirus (HzSNPV) were evaluated in the laboratory. In the first test, on second instar only, the time until death of lethally infected larvae of both species differed with the plant tissues (vegetative or reproductive) and plant species. The total viral activity produced per larva in LC50 units (occluded viral bodies (OBs) per larva/LC50 in OBs/mm2 of diet surface) was greater from H. virescens larvae fed vegetative than reproductive tissues of all host plants, but from H. zea virus production was greater only when fed vegetative tissue of soybean. In a second test that compared second and fourth instar H. virescens on cotton, total viral activity from larvae treated in both instars was greater when fed vegetative than reproductive tissues. Results of these tests suggest that the ability of host plants to influence baculovirus disease is more complex than previously believed. When examining the epizootic potential of a baculovirus, more attention must be given to the effects of the host plant on the insect--virus interactions.},

abstract = {Rather than being fixed, pathogen transmission varies and is thus an object of natural selection. I examine how opportunities for selection on pathogen transmission depend on (a) pathogen fitness, (b) genetic variability, and (c) forces acting at within- and between-host levels. The transmission rate, $\beta$, influences processes such as epidemic spread, postepidemic fade-outs, and low-level persistence. Complexity of infection processes within hosts leads to different transmission rates among hosts and between types of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, eukaryotic Protozoa). Generality emerges, however, by "unpacking" $\beta$ into within- and between-host opportunities for selection. This is illustrated by evolutionary biology of the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which causes plague in mammals, remains highly virulent and is transmitted by multiple routes, including fleas and direct contacts with infected hosts. The strength of within-host selection is manifested through infectivity, replication, pathogenicity, and dissemination from hosts. At the between-host level, responses to selection are less predictable because of environmental variation, whereas vector-borne transmission (usually by arthropods) provides additional opportunities for selection and trade-offs between vectors and hosts. In subdivided host populations, selection favors transmission before local pathogen extinction occurs, but key components (e.g. infectious periods of hosts) are determined by within-host dynamics. Pathogen transmission is often viewed in the context of transmission-virulence trade-offs, but within-host dynamics may cause host damage unrelated to transmission, and thus transmission-virulence trade-offs are not universal.

The ubiquity of this phenomenon, known as ‘intra-genotypic variability', is increasingly evident and the relevant mechanistic underpinnings are beginning to be understood. In parallel, theory has delineated a number of formal expectations for contexts in which such a feature would be adaptive. Here, we review empirical evidence across biological systems and theoretical expectations, including nonlinear averaging and bet hedging. We synthesize existing results to illustrate the dependence of selection outcomes both on trait characteristics, features of environmental variability, and species' demographic context.

Baculoviruses qualify as an effective, yet environmentally benign, biocontrol agent but their efficacy against generalist herbivores may be influenced by diet. However, few studies have investigated the tritrophic interactions of plant, pest, and pathogen from both a gene expression and physiological perspective. Here we use microscopy and transcriptomics to examine how diet affects the structure of peritrophic matrix (PM) in Trichoplusia ni larvae and consequently their susceptibility to the baculovirus, AcMNPV. Larvae raised on potato leaves had lower transcript levels for chitinase and chitin deacetylase genes, and possessed a thicker and more multi-layered PM than those raised on cabbage or artificial diet, which could contribute to their significantly lower susceptibility to the baculovirus. The consequences of these changes underline the importance of considering dietary influences on pathogen susceptibility in pest management strategies.},

abstract = {Summary 1 Studies have considered how intrinsic host and parasite properties determine parasite virulence, but have largely ignored the role of extrinsic ecological factors in its expression. 2 We studied how parasite genotype and host plant species interact to determine virulence of the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (McLaughlin & Myers 1970) in the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus L. We infected monarch larvae with one of four parasite genotypes and reared them on two milkweed species that differed in their levels of cardenolides: toxic chemicals involved in predator defence. 3 Parasite infection, replication and virulence were affected strongly by host plant species. While uninfected monarchs lived equally long on both plant species, infected monarchs suffered a greater reduction in their life spans (55% vs. 30%) on the low-cardenolide vs. the high-cardenolide host plant. These life span differences resulted from different levels of parasite replication in monarchs reared on the two plant species. 4 The virulence rank order of parasite genotypes was unaffected by host plant species, suggesting that host plant species affected parasite genotypes similarly, rather than through complex plant species--parasite genotype interactions. 5 Our results demonstrate that host ecology importantly affects parasite virulence, with implications for host--parasite dynamics in natural populations.},

abstract = {abstract: Models of outbreaks in forest‐defoliating insects are typically built from a priori considerations and tested only with long time series of abundances. We instead present a model built from experimental data on the gypsy moth and its nuclear polyhedrosis virus, which has been extensively tested with epidemic data. These data have identified key details of the gypsy moth--virus interaction that are missing from earlier models, including seasonality in host reproduction, delays between host infection and death, and heterogeneity among hosts in their susceptibility to the virus. Allowing for these details produces models in which annual epidemics are followed by bouts of reproduction among surviving hosts and leads to quite different conclusions than earlier models. First, these models suggest that pathogen‐driven outbreaks in forest defoliators occur partly because newly hatched insect larvae have higher average susceptibility than do older larvae. Second, the models show that a combination of seasonality and delays between infection and death can lead to unstable cycles in the absence of a stabilizing mechanism; these cycles, however, are stabilized by the levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility that we have observed in our experimental data. Moreover, our experimental estimates of virus transmission rates and levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility in gypsy moth populations give model dynamics that closely approximate the dynamics of real gypsy moth populations. Although we built our models from data for gypsy moth, our models are, nevertheless, quite general. Our conclusions are therefore likely to be true, not just for other defoliator‐pathogen interactions, but for many host‐pathogen interactions in which seasonality plays an important role. Our models thus give qualitative insight into the dynamics of host‐pathogen interactions, while providing a quantitative interpretation of our gypsy moth--virus data.},

abstract = {Empirical studies of the spatial spread of insect pathogens have emphasized the importance of high dispersal rates, but typically rely strictly on observational data. In contrast, existing mathematical models on the spatial spread of infectious diseases have suggested that a highly infectious disease can spread rapidly even if the dispersal rate of its host is low; such models, however, are largely untested. To understand how host dispersal and disease infectiousness affect the spatial spread of infectious disease, we performed a field experiment in which we released a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) into two experimentally established, disease---free gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations. We simultaneously and independently measured the long---distance dispersal of ballooning, first---instar, gypsy moth larvae, the stage in which dispersal is by far the greatest. Surprisingly, dispersal by ballooning was a good predictor of NPV spread only in the first few weeks of spread. Subsequently, the virus spread much farther and less directionally than did ballooning larvae. No infections appeared in control plots that started with only uninfected larvae, confirming that the virus we released caused the epizootic in our experimental populations. On the theory that additional spread was due to a combination of small---scale larval dispersal and a high rate of disease transmission, we compared our data to the predictions of a mathematical model for the spatial spread of insect pathogens that combines disease transmission and small---scale host dispersal. By using independent estimates of each of the model parameters, we used the model to make post hoc predictions of the rate of spread of the virus from an initial distribution dictated by larval ballooning. Although the model included both initial long---distance dispersal by larval ballooning and subsequent short---distance dispersal by larval crawling, it poorly matched the observed distribution of the virus. An alternative and as yet untested hypothesis is that the observed spread of the virus may be due to mechanical vectoring by a parasitoid fly, a mechanism for which there are as yet no available mathematical theory or relevant field data.},

abstract = {Most mathematical models of disease assume that transmission is linearly dependent on the densities of host and pathogen. Recent data for animal diseases, however, have cast doubt on this assumption, without assessing the usefulness of alternative models. In this article, we use a combination of laboratory dose-response experiments, field transmission experiments, and observations of naturally occurring populations to show that vines transmission in gypsy moths is a nonlinear function of virus density, apparently because of heterogeneity among individual gypsy moth larvae in their susceptibility to the virus. Dose-response experiments showed that larvae from a laboratory colony of gypsy moths are substantially less heterogeneous in their susceptibility to the virus than are larvae from feral populations, and field experiments showed that there is a more strongly nonlinear relationship between transmission and virus density for fetal larvae than for lab larvae. This nonlinearity in transmission changes the dynamics of the virus in natural populations so that a model incorporating host heterogeneity in susceptibility to the virus gives a much better fit to data on virus dynamics from large-scale field plots than does a classical model that ignores host heterogeneity. Our results suggest that heterogeneity among individuals has important effects on the dynamics of disease in insects at several spatial and temporal scales and that heterogeneity in susceptibility may be of general importance in the ecology of disease.},

We find that the parasite should kill the host when its per capita growth rate falls to the level of the host mortality rate. The parasite should kill its host later when the carrying capacity, K, is higher, but should kill it earlier when the parasite-independent host mortality increases or when the parasite has a higher birth rate. When K(t), for parasite growth, is not constant over the duration of an infection, but increases with time the parasite should kill the host around the stage when the growth rate of the carrying capacity decelerates strongly. In case that K(t) relates to host body size, this deceleration in growth is around host maturation.},

abstract = {Many forest insects undergo outbreaks, in which their densities rise from undetectable to extremely high. Outbreaks are widely assumed to be driven by specialist natural enemies such as infectious pathogens, but gypsy moth outbreaks show alternating severe and mild outbreaks in forests with a high percentage of oaks, a pattern that cannot be explained by host-pathogen models. We used an experiment to show that induced defenses in red oak reduce heterogeneity among gypsy moth larvae in the risk of virus infection, and extending standard models to allow for this effect produces alternating outbreaks, matching the data. The ability of our model to reproduce this complex pattern suggests that the role of induced defenses in insect outbreaks has been underestimated.Cyclic outbreaks of defoliating insects devastate forests, but their causes are poorly understood. Outbreak cycles are often assumed to be driven by density-dependent mortality due to natural enemies, because pathogens and predators cause high mortality and because natural-enemy models reproduce fluctuations in defoliation data. The role of induced defenses is in contrast often dismissed, because toxic effects of defenses are often weak and because induced-defense models explain defoliation data no better than natural-enemy models. Natural-enemy models, however, fail to explain gypsy moth outbreaks in North America, in which outbreaks in forests with a higher percentage of oaks have alternated between severe and mild, whereas outbreaks in forests with a lower percentage of oaks have been uniformly moderate. Here we show that this pattern can be explained by an interaction between induced defenses and a natural enemy. We experimentally induced hydrolyzable-tannin defenses in red oak, to show that induction reduces variability in a gypsy moth{\textquoteright}s risk of baculovirus infection. Because this effect can modulate outbreak severity and because oaks are the only genus of gypsy moth host tree that can be induced, we extended a natural-enemy model to allow for spatial variability in inducibility. Our model shows alternating outbreaks in forests with a high frequency of oaks, and uniform outbreaks in forests with a low frequency of oaks, matching the data. The complexity of this effect suggests that detecting effects of induced defenses on defoliator cycles requires a combination of experiments and models.},

abstract = {Abstract Phenotypic variation is common in most pathogens, yet the mechanisms that maintain this diversity are still poorly understood. We asked whether continuous host variation in susceptibility helps maintain phenotypic variation, using experiments conducted with a baculovirus that infects gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larvae. We found that an empirically observed tradeoff between mean transmission rate and variation in transmission, which results from host heterogeneity, promotes long-term coexistence of two pathogen types in simulations of a population model. This tradeoff introduces an alternative strategy for the pathogen: a low-transmission, low-variability type can coexist with the high-transmission type favoured by classical non-heterogeneity models. In addition, this tradeoff can help explain the extensive phenotypic variation we observed in field-collected pathogen isolates, in traits affecting virus fitness including transmission and environmental persistence. Similar heterogeneity tradeoffs might be a general mechanism promoting phenotypic variation in any pathogen for which hosts vary continuously in susceptibility.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated high levels of genotypic and phenotypic variation in populations of parasites, even within individual hosts. Several genetic, immunological and epidemiological mechanisms have been postulated as promoters of such variation, but little empirical work has addressed the role of host ecology. A nucleopolyhedrovirus that attacks larvae of the pine beauty moth, Panolis flammea, exists as a complex mixture of genotypes within individual host larvae. We demonstrate that the food plant species eaten by the host (Scots pine vs. lodgepole pine) differentially affects the pathogenicity and productivity of two virus genotypes originally purified from a single host individual. We hypothesize that such food plant-mediated differential selection will promote genotypic variation between baculovirus populations, and that subsequent remixing of virus genotypes could maintain genotypic variation within individual hosts. Our results provide a tritrophic explanation for the genotypic and phenotypic complexity of host--parasite interactions with complex ecologies.},

abstract = {Although wound-induced responses in plants are widespread, neither the ecological nor the evolutionary significance of phytochemical induction is clear. Several studies have shown, for example, that induced responses can act against both plant pathogens and herbivores simultaneously. We present the first evidence that phytochemical induction can inhibit a pathogen of the herbivore responsible for the defoliation. In 1990, we generated leaf damage by enclosing gypsy moth larvae on branches of red oak trees. We then inoculated a second cohort of larvae with a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (LdNPV) on foliage from the damaged branches. Larvae were less susceptible to virus consumed on foliage from branches with increasing levels of defoliation, and with higher concentrations of gallotannin. Defoliation itself was not related to any of our chemistry measures. Field sampling supported the results of our experiments: death from virus among feral larvae collected from unmanipulated trees was also negatively correlated with defoliation. In 1991, defoliation and gallotannin were again found to inhibit the virus. In addition, gallotannin concentrations were found to be positively correlated with defoliation the previous year. Compared with previous results that demonstrated a deleterious effect of induction on gypsy moth pupal weight and fecundity, the inhibition of the virus should confer an advantage to the gypsy moth. Since leaf damage levels increase as gypsy moth density increases, and since leaf damage inhibits the gypsy moth virus, there is the potential for positive feedback in the system. If phytochemical induction in red oak can inhibit an animal pathogen such as LdNPV, it suggests to us that induction in red oak is a generalized response to tissue damage rather than an adaptive defense against herbivores.},

abstract = {Compartmental epidemic models have been used extensively to study the historical spread of infectious diseases and to inform strategies for future control. A critical parameter of any such model is the transmission rate. Temporal variation in the transmission rate has a profound influence on disease spread. For this reason, estimation of time-varying transmission rates is an important step in identifying mechanisms that underlie patterns in observed disease incidence and mortality. Here, we present and test fast methods for reconstructing transmission rates from time series of reported incidence. Using simulated data, we quantify the sensitivity of these methods to parameters of the data-generating process and to mis-specification of input parameters by the user. We show that sensitivity to the user's estimate of the initial number of susceptible individuals—considered to be a major limitation of similar methods—can be eliminated by an efficient, “peak-to-peak” iterative technique, which we propose. The method of transmission rate estimation that we advocate is extremely fast, for even the longest infectious disease time series that exist. It can be used independently or as a fast way to obtain better starting conditions for computationally expensive methods, such as iterated filtering and generalized profiling.},

abstract = {AbstractPathogen population dynamics within individual hosts can alter disease epidemics and pathogen evolution, but our understanding of the mechanisms driving within-host dynamics is weak. Mathematical models have provided useful insights, but existing models have only rarely been subjected to rigorous tests, and their reliability is therefore open to question. Most models assume that initial pathogen population sizes are so large that stochastic effects due to small population sizes, so-called demographic stochasticity, are negligible, but whether this assumption is reasonable is unknown. Most models also assume that the dynamic effects of a host's immune system strongly affect pathogen incubation times or ``response times,'' but whether such effects are important in real host-pathogen interactions is likewise unknown. Here we use data for a baculovirus of the gypsy moth to test models of within-host pathogen growth. By using Bayesian statistical techniques and formal model-selection procedures, we are able to show that the response time of the gypsy moth virus is strongly affected by both demographic stochasticity and a dynamic response of the host immune system. Our results imply that not all response-time variability can be explained by host and pathogen variability, and that immune system responses to infection may have important effects on population-level disease dynamics.},

Most often these rates must be estimated from longitudinal field data, which are costly and time-consuming to conduct. Consequently, measures to reduce cost like increased sampling intervals or subsampling of the population are implemented. To assess the impact of such measures we implement two different SIS models to simulate disease transmission: A simple closed population model and a realistic dairy herd including population dynamics. We analyze the accuracy of different methods for estimating the transmission rate. We use data from the two simulation models and vary the sampling intervals and the size of the population sampled. We devise two new methods to determine transmission rate, and compare these to the frequently used Poisson regression method in both epidemic and endemic situations. For most tested scenarios these new methods perform similar or better than Poisson regression, especially in the case of long sampling intervals. We conclude that transmission rate estimates are easily biased, which is important to take into account when using these rates in simulation models.},

abstract = {Ecologists worldwide are challenged to contribute solutions to urgent and pressing environmental problems by forecasting how populations, communities, and ecosystems will respond to global change. Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding. Given the constraints inherent in the study of infectious disease and the urgent need for progress, fusion of data and expertise via this type of conceptual framework should prove an indispensable tool. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

abstract = { On theoretical grounds, we argue that parasite-host systems are ideal candidates for interdemic or "group" selection because of the potential for selection for avirulence based upon reduced host (hence group) survival. Such selection appears to have been an important ingredient in the stabilization of the myxomatosis-rabbit system in Australia, although clearly the evolution of resistance in the rabbit population also played a part. We present a simple mathematical model to demonstrate how easily group selection can (in theory) stabilize a parasite-host system. This model is not meant to be a literal translation of the myxomatosis-rabbit interaction, and in fact intentionally disregards host evolution; its purpose is to isolate the role of group selection in the parasite population. Fenner has established that both interdemic selection and host evolution were important in the stabilization of that system, although our model demonstrates that in theory interdemic selection alone could stabilize the interaction. Our central point is that selection for avirulence in the parasite population is important in the evolution of stability in parasite-host systems (Fenner and Myers 1978). The obvious next step, both from the general theoretical viewpoint and specifically with regard to the myxoma-rabbit system, will be to consider models in which both host and parasite are permitted to coevolve. We feel, as do many others, that modeling of coevolution of parasite-host systems has not received the attention deserved in theoretical ecology, and that because of the interdependence of the elements these associations represent much better candidates for such theory than the more popular predator-prey or competition systems. Moreover, as Donald R. Strong, Jr., has pointed out to us, a broad range of organisms are functionally parasitic and the ideas that we have developed herein apply to these as well as to the more restricted class of species which are the conventional organisms treated in parasitology. },

abstract = {Symptom severity affects disease transmission both by impacting contact rates, as well as by influencing the probability of transmission given contact. This involves a trade-off between these two factors, as increased symptom severity will tend to decrease contact rates, but increase the probability of transmission given contact (as pathogen shedding rates increase with symptom severity). This paper explores this trade-off between contact and transmission given contact, using a simple compartmental susceptible-infected-recovered type model. Under mild assumptions on how contact and transmission probability vary with symptom severity, we give sufficient, biologically intuitive criteria for when the basic reproduction number varies non-monotonically with symptom severity. Multiple critical points are possible. We give a complete characterization of the region in parameter space where multiple critical points are located in the special case where contact rate decreases exponentially with symptom severity. We consider a multi-strain version of the model with complete cross-immunity and no super-infection. In this model, we prove that the strain with highest basic reproduction number drives the other strains to extinction. This has both evolutionary and epidemiological implications, including the possibility of an intervention paradoxically resulting in increased infection prevalence.},

abstract = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Abstract Host–pathogen models are essential for designing strategies for managing disease threats to humans, wild animals and domestic animals. The behaviour of these models is greatly affected by the way in which transmission between infected and susceptible hosts is modelled. Since host–pathogen models were first developed at the beginning of the 20th century, the ‘mass action' assumption has almost always been used for transmission. Recently, however, it has been suggested that mass action has often been modelled wrongly. Alternative models of transmission are beginning to appear, as are empirical tests of transmission dynamics.},

abstract = {Transmission is a fundamental step in the life cycle of every parasite but it is also one of the most challenging processes to model and quantify. In most host–parasite models, the transmission process is encapsulated by a single parameter $\beta$ . Many different biological processes and interactions, acting on both hosts and infectious organisms, are subsumed in this single term. There are, however, at least two undesirable consequences of this high level of abstraction. First, nonlinearities and heterogeneities that can be critical to the dynamic behaviour of infections are poorly represented; second, estimating the transmission coefficient $\beta$ from field data is often very difficult. In this paper, we present a conceptual model, which breaks the transmission process into its component parts. This deconstruction enables us to identify circumstances that generate nonlinearities in transmission, with potential implications for emergent transmission behaviour at individual and population scales. Such behaviour cannot be explained by the traditional linear transmission frameworks. The deconstruction also provides a clearer link to the empirical estimation of key components of transmission and enables the construction of flexible models that produce a unified understanding of the spread of both micro- and macro-parasite infectious disease agents.},

abstract = { AbstractA key assumption of epidemiological models is that population-scale disease spread is driven by close contact between hosts and pathogens. At larger scales, however, mechanisms such as spatial structure in host and pathogen populations and environmental heterogeneity could alter disease spread. The assumption that small-scale transmission mechanisms are sufficient to explain large-scale infection rates, however, is rarely tested. Here, we provide a rigorous test using an insect-baculovirus system. We fit a mathematical model to data from forest-wide epizootics while constraining the model parameters with data from branch-scale experiments, a difference in spatial scale of four orders of magnitude. This experimentally constrained model fits the epizootic data well, supporting the role of small-scale transmission, but variability is high. We then compare this model's performance to an unconstrained model that ignores the experimental data, which serves as a proxy for models with additional mechanisms. The unconstrained model has a superior fit, revealing a higher transmission rate across forests compared with branch-scale estimates. Our study suggests that small-scale transmission is insufficient to explain baculovirus epizootics. Further research is needed to identify the mechanisms that contribute to disease spread across large spatial scales, and synthesizing models and multiscale data are key to understanding these dynamics. },

abstract = {Parasite-mediated selection is potentially of great importance in modulating genetic diversity. Genetic variation for resistance, the fuel for natural selection, appears to be common in host-parasite interactions, but responses to selection are rarely observed. In the present study, we tested whether environmental variation could mediate infection and determine evolutionary outcomes. Temperature was shown to dramatically alter the potential for parasite-mediated selection in two independent laboratory infection experiments at four temperatures. The bacterial parasite, Pasteuria ramosa, was extremely virulent at 20°C and 25°C, sterilizing its host, Daphnia magna, so that females often never produced a single brood. However, at 10°C and 15°C, the host-parasite interaction was much more benign, as nearly all females produced broods before becoming sterile. This association between virulence and temperature alone could stabilize coexistence and lead to the maintenance of diversity, because it would weaken parasite-mediated selection during parts of the season. Additionally, highly significant genotype-by-environment interactions were found, with changes in clone rank order for infection rates at different temperatures. Our results clearly show that the outcome of parasite-mediated selection in this system is strongly context dependent.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Studies of variability in host resistance to disease generally emphasize variability in susceptibility given exposure, neglecting the possibility that hosts may vary in behaviours that affect the risk of exposure. 2. In many insects, horizontal transmission of baculoviruses occurs when larvae consume foliage contaminated by the cadavers of virus-infected conspecific larvae; so, host behaviour may have a strong effect on the risk of infection. 3. We studied variability in the behaviour of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larvae, which are able to detect and avoid virus-contaminated foliage. 4. Our results show that detection ability can be affected by the family line that larvae originate from, even at some distance from a virus-infected cadaver, and suggest that cadaver-detection ability may be heritable. 5. There is thus the potential for natural selection to act on cadaver-detection ability, and thereby to affect the dynamics of pathogen-driven cycles in gypsy moth populations. 6. We argue that host behaviour is a neglected component in studies of variability in disease resistance.},

abstract = {Natural populations of pathogens are frequently composed of numerous interacting strains. Understanding what maintains this diversity remains a key focus of research in disease ecology. In addition, within-host pathogen dynamics can have a strong impact on both infection outcome and the evolution of pathogen virulence, and thus, understanding the impact of pathogen diversity is important for disease management. We compared eight genetically distinguishable variants from Spodoptera exempta nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpexNPV) isolated from the African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta. NPVs are obligate killers, and the vast majority of transmission stages are not released until after the host has died. The NPV variants differed significantly in their virulence and could be clustered into two groups based on their dose-response curves. They also differed in their speed of kill and productivity (transmission potential) for S. exempta. The mixed-genotype wild-type (WT) SpexNPV, from which each variant was isolated, was significantly more virulent than any individual variant and its mean mortality rate was within the fastest group of individual variants. However, the WT virus produced fewer new infectious stages than any single variant, which might reflect competition among the variants. A survival analysis, combining the mortality and speed of kill data, confirmed the superiority of the genetically mixed WT virus over any single variant. Spodoptera exempta larvae infected with WT SpexNPV were predicted to die 2{\textperiodcentered}7 and 1{\textperiodcentered}9 times faster than insects infected with isolates from either of the two clusters of genotypes. Theory suggests that there are likely to be trade-offs between pathogen fitness traits. Across all larvae, there was a negative linear relationship between virus yield and speed of kill, such that more rapid host death carried the cost of producing fewer transmission stages. We also found a near-significant relationship for the same trend at the intervariant level. However, there was no evidence for a significant relationship between the induced level of mortality and transmission potential (virus yield) or speed of kill.},

abstract = {Plant-mediated variations in the outcomes of host-pathogen interactions can strongly affect epizootics and the population dynamics of numerous species, including devastating agricultural pests such as the fall armyworm. Most studies of plant-mediated effects on insect pathogens focus on host mortality, but few have measured pathogen yield, which can affect whether or not an epizootic outbreak occurs. Insects challenged with baculoviruses on different plant species and parts can vary in levels of mortality and yield of infectious stages (occlusion bodies; OBs). We previously demonstrated that soybean genotypes and induced anti-herbivore defenses influence baculovirus infectivity. Here, we used a soybean genotype that strongly reduced baculovirus infectivity when virus was ingested on induced plants (Braxton) and another that did not reduce infectivity (Gasoy), to determine how soybean genotype and induced defenses influence OB yield and speed of kill. These are key fitness measures because baculoviruses are obligate-killing pathogens. We challenged fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, with the baculovirus S. frugiperda multi-nucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (SfMNPV) during short or long-term exposure to plant treatments (i.e., induced or non-induced genotypes). Caterpillars were either fed plant treatments only during virus ingestion (short-term exposure to foliage) or from the point of virus ingestion until death (long-term exposure). We found trade-offs of increasing OB yield with slower speed of kill and decreasing virus dose. OB yield increased more with longer time to death and decreased more with increasing virus dose after short-term feeding on Braxton compared with Gasoy. OB yield increased significantly more with time to death in larvae that fed until death on non-induced foliage than induced foliage. Moreover, fewer OBs per unit of host tissue were produced when larvae were fed induced foliage than non-induced foliage. These findings highlight the potential importance of plant effects, even at the individual plant level, on entomopathogen fitness, which may impact epizootic transmission events and host population dynamics.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: Genotype by environment (G × E) interactions are important for the long-term persistence of plant species in heterogeneous environments. It has often been suggested that disease is a key factor for the maintenance of genotypic diversity in plant populations. However, empirical evidence for this contention is scarce. Here virus infection is proposed as a possible candidate for maintaining genotypic diversity in their host plants. Methods The effects of White clover mosaic virus (WClMV) on the performance and development of different Trifolium repens genotypes were analysed and the G × E interactions were examined with respect to genotype-specific plant responses to WClMV infection. Thus, the environment is defined as the presence or absence of the virus. Key Results WClMV had a negative effect on plant performance as shown by a decrease in biomass and number of ramets. These effects of virus infection differ greatly among host genotypes, representing a strong G × E interaction. Moreover, the relative fitness and associated ranking of genotypes changed significantly between control and virus treatments. This shift in relative fitness among genotypes suggests the potential for WClMV to provoke differential selection on T. repens genotypes, which may lead to negative frequency-dependent selection in host populations. Conclusions The apparent G × E interaction and evident repercussions for relative fitness reported in this study stress the importance of viruses for ecological and evolutionary processes and suggest an important role for viruses in shaping population dynamics and micro-evolutionary processes. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

The mechanism of viral enhancement, however, has not been elucidated. We used a reporter gene recombinant ofAutographa californicaMNPV (AcMNPV-hsp70/lacZ) to investigate the enhancing effects of M2R on pathogenesis, mortality and time to death in larvae ofTrichoplusia ni,andHeliothis virescensinoculated as newly molted fourth instars (40s) and at various hours after molting (e.g., 16 h=416). For both hosts, M2R significantly reduced the time to death by AcMNPV. In 40-inoculated larvae, M2R accelerated infection of tracheal cells, but overall the effects on pathogenesis were minor, and no significant increase in mortality over controls was observed. Among infected M2R-treated 416H. virescens,there were significantly more foci per insect compared to controls, and first lacZ expression was detected in the midgut epithelium at 6 h postinoculation (hpi). In contrast, no lacZ signals were detected in the midgut epithelia of control insects at any time point, and first lacZ expression was observed in the tracheal system at 14 hpi. When we compared virus-induced mortality inH. virescensinoculated at various times during the fourth instar, we found that M2R treatment enhanced mortality levels progressively for larvae inoculated later during the instar. Our results suggested that inT. niandH. virescens,M2R enhanced AcMNPV pathogenesis by blocking the sloughing of infected primary target cells in the midgut, thereby countering developmental resistance and increasing mortality.},

abstract = {A bimodal temporal pattern of mortality caused by the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) was observed in nine gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations of varying densities. In all cases, peak mortality from NPV occurred during the second wave (late larval instars) and the highest mortality occurred in high density populations. Patterns of NPV mortality were established several weeks before being expressed. There was no discernible correlation between weekly mortality rates and temperature, rainfall, or total solar radiation. The bimodality was also apparent in NPV contamination on foliage which was measured by bioassay. A similar pattern was observed in the laboratory among larvae reared in groups from field-collected egg masses and from eggs artificially contaminated with NPV from a laboratory population. As in field populations, the period of low mortality from NPV between the two waves occurred when most larvae were late third and fourth instars. Larvae reared individually did not exhibit the second wave of mortality.},

@article{WoolhouseEtAl1997,
abstract = {From an analysis of the distributions of measures of transmission rates among hosts, we identify an empirical relationship suggesting that, typically, 20% of the host population contributes at least 80% of the net transmission potential, as measured by the basic reproduction number, R0. This is an example of a statistical pattern known as the 20/80 rule. The rule applies to a variety of disease systems, including vector-borne parasites and sexually transmitted pathogens. The rule implies that control programs targeted at the 'core' 20% group are potentially highly effective and, conversely, that programs that fail to reach all of this group will be much less effective than expected in reducing levels of infection in the population as a whole.},
